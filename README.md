## Features
- Self-supervised pretraining on multi-spectral satellite imagery.
- Fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks like land-cover classification and object detection.
- Extensible architecture that supports various multi-spectral datasets.
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy and mean Average Precision (mAP).

## Requirements
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- CUDA 11.0 (optional but recommended for GPU support)
- `torchvision`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- `timm` (for pre-built transformer models)
- `scikit-learn` (for evaluation metrics)
- `tqdm` (for progress bars)

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision timm scikit-learn numpy matplotlib tqdm
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techmn/satmae_pp.git
   cd satmae_pp
   ```

2. Set up the Python environment. If you are using virtual environments, create one:

   ```bash
   python -m venv satmae_env
   source satmae_env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: satmae_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages (listed above) using `pip`.

## Dataset Preparation

The model is designed to work with multi-spectral satellite imagery. The dataset used in this project is the [Functional Map of the World (fMoW)](https://registry.opendata.aws/fmow/). Follow the steps below to prepare the dataset:

1. **Download the fMoW dataset**:
   You can download the dataset directly from AWS OpenData. Follow the instructions [here](https://registry.opendata.aws/fmow/).

2. **Extract the dataset**:
   After downloading the dataset, extract the images and annotations to your desired directory.

   Example directory structure:
   ```
   dataset/
   ├── train/
   │   ├── img_001.tif
   │   ├── img_002.tif
   │   └── ...
   ├── val/
   │   ├── img_101.tif
   │   └── ...
   └── test/
       ├── img_201.tif
       └── ...
   ```

3. **Preprocess the dataset**:
   Run the following script to preprocess the images (normalization, resizing, etc.):

   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess_dataset.py --data-dir dataset/
   ```

   This script will normalize the spectral bands and prepare the data for model input.

## Pretraining

SatMAE++ uses a self-supervised pretraining strategy. To start the pretraining process, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --mode pretrain --data-dir dataset/ --batch-size 256 --epochs 800 --lr 1e-4
```

Parameters:
- `--mode pretrain`: Specifies that the model should run in pretraining mode.
- `--data-dir`: Directory containing the fMoW dataset.
- `--batch-size`: Batch size for training (default: 256).
- `--epochs`: Number of pretraining epochs (default: 800).
- `--lr`: Learning rate for the optimizer (default: 1e-4).

Pretrained model checkpoints will be saved in the `checkpoints/` directory.

## Fine-tuning

After pretraining, the model can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks, such as land-cover classification or object detection.

To fine-tune the model, run:

```bash
python main.py --mode finetune --data-dir dataset/ --batch-size 128 --epochs 100 --lr 1e-5 --pretrained checkpoints/pretrain_model.pth
```

Parameters:
- `--mode finetune`: Runs the model in fine-tuning mode.
- `--pretrained`: Specifies the path to the pretrained model checkpoint.
- `--lr`: Reduced learning rate for fine-tuning (default: 1e-5).
- `--epochs`: Number of fine-tuning epochs (default: 100).

## Evaluation

To evaluate the fine-tuned model, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --mode evaluate --data-dir dataset/ --pretrained checkpoints/finetuned_model.pth
```

The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy and mean Average Precision (mAP).

## Results

Once the evaluation is complete, you can visualize the results using the following script:

```bash
python scripts/visualize_results.py --results-dir results/
```

The script will generate figures comparing SatMAE++ with baseline models for various tasks, such as land-cover classification and object detection.
